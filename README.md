# 00016003.WAD.Codebase
This application was developed for Web
Application module, as coursework portfolio project @ WIUT by student ID: 00016003
This is a simple web application for managing keys using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach. It is designed to allow users to store, update, and retrieve key data (such as "Name" and "Value"). The application uses Entity Framework Core and SQL Server for data storage and provides an API with Swagger integration for easy documentation and testing.
I used Nuget packages.
